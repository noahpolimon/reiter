# reiter

`reiter` enables Ziglings to effortlessly create their own iterators for any type of their choice, it being native Zig types, std library types or your own structs.

This library takes inspiration and several ideas from the [zig-iter](https://github.com/softprops/zig-iter) library and Rust's [std::iter::Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) trait.

> This is still a WIP. I do not currently completely understand neither Zig nor Rust.
  
## Methods

`.next()` 
- This is the main method that pretty much every variations/wrapper of `Iter` uses in this library. It yields the next element from the iterator.

`.nth(n)`
- Advances the iterator by `n`, then returns the next element. Returns `null` if the iterator is consumed before `n` is reached.

`.min()`
- Consumes the iterator to obtain the minimum value from the iterator. Type of `Item` should be comparable.

`.max()`
- Consumes the iterator to obtain the maximum value from the iterator. Type of `Item` should be comparable.

`.count()` 
- Consumes the iterator to count its number of elements.

`.forEach(func)` 
- Consumes the iterator and applies the function on each elements. This method does not yield anything.

`.fold(type, acc, func)` 
- Consumes the iterator and folds it into a single value of a specified type by accumulating a value computed by the function.

`.find(func)`
- Finds the first item for which the predicate is true.

`.reduce(func)` 
- Similar to the `.fold()` method but converges to a value the same type or `null` if the iterator is empty, thus not requiring an initial value.

`.last()` 
- Consumes the iterator and returns the last value of the iterator. 

`.enumerate()` 
- Makes the iterator yield enumerated values in the form of `struct { usize, Item }` tuples.

`.filter(predicate)`
- Makes the iterator yield only values for which the predicate is true.

`.filterMap(type, func)`
- Filters and maps values for which `func` does not return `null` 

`.map(type, func)`
- Transforms values to a specified type using `func` before yielding them. 

`.mapWhile(type, func)`
- Makes the iterator yield mapped values while `func` does not return a `null`. 

`.take(n)`
- Makes the iterator yield only its first `n` elements.

`.takeWhile(predicate)`
- Makes the iterator yield elements for which the predicate is true. 

`.chain(other)`
- Chains another iterator that yields the same value type as the iterator. The values of the other iterator will be yielded after the original one is consumed.

`.zip(other)`
- Makes an iterator yield paired values in the form of `struct { T, U }` where `T` is the type that the original iterator yields and `U` is the type that the other iterator yields. It yields `null` when 1 of the iterators is consumed.

`.peekable(other)`
- Provides the `.peek()` method to allow getting the next value from the iterator without advancing it.

`.cycle()`
- Makes an iterator loop back to the start instead of yielding `null` when it is consumed

`.skip(n)`
- Makes the iterator skip `n` elements every time it yields an element.

`.stepBy(n)`
- Simillar to `.skip()`. However the first element of the iterator is yielded, then `n` elements are skipped.

## "Implementing" Iter

`Iter` is a generic iterator that yields values from some kind of collection, range, indexable, etc... lazily. Iterators should have the following when "implementing" `Iter`:

- `Item` - The `Item` declaration __*should*__ be public and equal to the type of values the iterator yields. 
- `fn next(*@This()) ?Item` - The `next` method __*should*__ be public, take a _non-const_ pointer to `@This()` and return an _optional_ `Item`.

An example implementation would be:

```zig
// Import `Iter` from the lib 
const Iter = @import("reiter").Iter;

// Create the iterator type
const MyIterator = struct {
    const Self = @This();

    // This is necessary so as to allow adapters such as Map and Filter to
    // obtain the type your iterator is yielding.
    pub const Item = u8;

    index: usize = 0,
    buffer: []const u8 = "wxyz",

    pub fn next(self: *Self) ?Item {
        if (self.index >= self.buffer.len) 
            return null;

        const ret = self.buffer[self.index];
        self.index += 1;
        return ret;
    }

    // This is just an example. You may choose to use an `init` or `from`
    // method or any other way. However, any equivalent method/function to the 
    // one below should return `Iter(@This())`.
    pub fn iter(self: Self) Iter(Self) {
        return .{
            .impl = self,
        };
    }
};
```

After creating an iterator it is possible to use and chain them like any Rust iterators.

```zig
const my_iterator = MyIterator{};

var x = my_iterator.iter()
    .stepBy(1)
    .enumerate()
    .take(2)
    .map(u32, struct {
    fn call(i: struct { usize, u8 }) u32 {
        const j: u32 = @intCast(i.@"0");
        return j + i.@"1";
    }
}.call);
```

Apart from this minor detail :/

```zig
struct {
    fn call(i: struct { usize, u8 }) u32 {
        const j: u32 = @intCast(i.@"0");
        return j + i.@"1";
    }
}.call
```

Zig does not (and i think most likely will not) have a simpler way to make closures.

## Examples

More examples are found in the `examples` directory. 

## Initializers

Initializers are pre-made functions that can be used to create iterators for a particular Zig type or use case.

`empty(type)`
- Creates an iterator that does not yield anything.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.empty(u32);

    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`once(type, item)`
- Creates an iterator that yields `item` only once.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.once(u32, 50);

    _ = i.next(); // 50
    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`lazyOnce(type, func)`
- Creates an iterator that yields the return value of `func` once.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.lazyOnce(u32, struct {
        fn call() u32 {
            return 50;
        }
    }.call);

    _ = i.next(); // 50
    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`repeat(type, item)`
- Creates an iterator that yields `item` repeatedly. This is the equivalent of using `once().cycle()`.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.repeat(u32, 50);
    
    for (0..1_000_000) |_| {
        _ = i.next(); // always returns 50
    }
    ```

`repeatN(type, item, n)`
- Creates an iterator that yields `item` `n` times. This is the equivalent of using `once().cycle().take(n)`.

    ```zig
    const n: usize = 3;
    var i = reiter.repeatN(u32, 50, n);
    
    for (0..n) |_| {
        _ = i.next(); // 50
    }

    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`lazyRepeat(type, item)`
- Creates an iterator that yields the return value of `func` repeatedly.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.lazyRepeat(u32, struct {
        fn call() u32 {
            return 50;
        }
    }.call);
    
    for (0..1_000_000) |_| {
        _ = i.next(); // always returns 50
    }
    ```

`fromSlice(type, slice)`
- Creates an iterator that yields elements of a slice.

    ```zig
    const arr = [_]u32{ 0, 1, 2};
    var i = reiter.fromSlice(u32, &arr);
    
    _ = i.next(); // 0
    _ = i.next(); // 1
    _ = i.next(); // 2
    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`fromRange(type, start, end)`
- Creates an iterator from an integer range. The end value is exclusive.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.fromRange(u32, 0, 2);
    
    _ = i.next(); // 0
    _ = i.next(); // 1
    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`fromRangeStep(type, start, end, step)`
- Similar to `fromRange()`. However, the step can be modified. Negative step is possible as long as start > end, which is not possible with `.stepBy()`. 

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.fromRangeStep(u32, 0, 5, 2);
    
    _ = i.next(); // 0
    _ = i.next(); // 2
    _ = i.next(); // 4
    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

`recurse(type, init, func)`
- Computes the value of the next iteration from the last yielded value. `init` is yielded first then the next value is computed from it.

    ```zig
    var i = reiter.recurse(u32, 0, struct {
        fn call(x: u32) ?u32 {
            if (x >= 5) return null;
            return x;
        }
    }.call);
    
    _ = i.next(); // 0
    _ = i.next(); // 1
    _ = i.next(); // 2
    _ = i.next(); // 3
    _ = i.next(); // 4
    _ = i.next(); // null
    ```

## Using reiter

First, fetch the source using this command inside your Zig project:

```bash
zig fetch --save https://github.com/noahpolimon/reiter/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
```

> Note that reiter is currently not stable. For now, you will need to fetch the main source.

Then, add it in your `build.zig` file as a module.

```diff
// code
+ const reiter = b.dependency("reiter", .{
+     .target = target,
+     .optimize = optimize,
+ }).module("reiter");

const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
    .name = "my_project",
    .root_module = exe_mod,
});

+ exe.root_module.addImport("reiter", reiter);

b.installArtifact(exe);
// code
```

The last step is to run:

```bash
zig build
```

Voila! You may now import and use the reiter library.
